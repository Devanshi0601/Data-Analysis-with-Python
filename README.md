FANDANGO- A BAISED MOVIE RATING WEBSITE

Overview:
If one is planning on going out to see a movie, how well can one trust online reviews and ratings? Especially if the same company showing the rating also makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?
Fandango is a movie tickets booking website, which also rates movies. In October 2015, FiveThirtyEight published a story calling Fandango's metrics on user ratings into question. The investigation noted that the site's method for calculating ratings made it rare for a movie to ever receive an overall rating below three stars.
The project is based on the article https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/.

Goal: To determine if Fandango's ratings in 2015 had a bias towards rating movies better to sell more tickets.
